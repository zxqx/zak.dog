Growing up I always had a healthy distrust for banks. Something about an institution having access to my personal identity and all the financial transactions associated with it never sat well with me. The fact that I had to so comprehensively depend on a third party for such critical operations as food and shelter is so radically opposed to my uncompromising desire for complete independence.

In some not-so-distant parallel universe, there's an old shoe box buried three feet deep in my backyard holding my entire life savings.

But time went on and I fell in line like everyone else did. And I got used to it. I became a normal contributing member of society, conforming to all the systems and constructs we created to facilitate large scale human coordination.

I got a job. I bought a car. I opened a bank account.

As the years went on, I became more and more comfortable with the idea of keeping my money in a bank. The convenience it afforded me was enough to suppress that nagging feeling that something about it was off.

Until one morning without notice, my bank account was frozen.

At this time in my life, I didn't even have a savings or investment account -- I kept all the cash I earned in a single checking account. I liked the simplicity of having it all in one place. Knowing it was safe and that I could access it any time I needed gave me peace of mind.

I was wrong.

A 10-day investigation concluded in a false alarm, all stemming from a $100 deposit I made to an overseas poker site that triggered some suspicious activity detection algorithm. Meanwhile I had no way to access my funds and had to uncomfortably resort to borrowing money from people I barely knew in a city I had just moved to.

I felt helpless, frustrated, and disillusioned. I was at the mercy of a multi-billion dollar institution existing within a corrupt banking system that would rather micromanage and overregulate the activities of its everyday citizens while wealthy elites orchestrate earth-shattering financial crimes in plain sight on a daily basis.

But there was nothing I could do about it. These were the systems we had, for better or worse.

Fast-forward to 2018.

It was after midnight on a hot August weekday when I fatefully stumbled upon the Bitcoin whitepaper. Eight pages containing some of the most compelling software design I'd ever seen. It sought to obliterate everything wrong with the traditional banking system: overbearing government oversight, financial censorship, and the need for trusted intermediaries.

I was hooked.

I started reading and absorbing everything I could about it, even building my own proof-of-work blockchain which I ran on my local machine as a means of understanding the tech more deeply. What I didn't realize at the time is that I was just starting to scratch the surface of a whole new frontier of finance and technology. A brand new paradigm that would warrant most of my waking thought and energy over the next few years.

I dove in headfirst. And the deeper I went, the bigger the rabbithole got. It wasn't just Bitcoin, a new kind of uncensorable currency, standing alone in this space. There were trustless application layers like Ethereum, decentralized financial products for earning and borrowing money, and immutable and interoperable digital items that people could share and trade peer-to-peer.

It was new. It was exciting. And most importantly for me, it was trustless. I didn't need to sign up for an account and hand over my personal information to a third party to participate.

It was called *crypto*.

One of the core features of crypto is that its technology offers a novel means of coordination. A more equitable incentive layer where anyone can have a voice, and value can accrue fairly across the contribution pool rather than to a select group of elites. This proposition is what fueled the last few years of crypto innovation, leading to the explosion of DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.

We weren't just reinventing money, we were reinventing the world. We were building a whole new system. The *right* system.

But building the right system isn't enough.

The benefits of technology will always be dictated by the ways in which humans use it, and this is a problem that technology itself cannot solve without removing humans from the picture. We cannot solve large scale human coordination purely by changing technology.

We must also change humans.

Humans are inherently flawed and greed-driven, and the materialization of the crypto space is a stark reflection of that. The last few years has shown us that if there is any room to exploit a system for nefarious purposes, it will be done.

Scams, project rugpulls, smart contract exploits, governance plutocracies. Comically overleveraged institutions built on fractional banking. Centralized projects masquerading as the next generation of finance and ownership, funded by the same venture capital that delivered us the maximalist data privacy exploitation of the modern internet.

The space is littered with them. And game theory dictates that they aren't going away anytime soon.

How do you fix a system where humans, not technology, are the core problem?

This is a question I've thought about a lot over the past few months, and I still don't have a good answer. My intuition tells me that stricter regulation will only serve to recreate the same issues and power imbalances we see in the traditional banking world, and you could argue that it's already happening in real-time.

This isn't an elegy or a condemnation of the space as a whole, nor is it my swan song. This is a sober personal reflection that the vision and reality of crypto are worlds apart from each other.

And the technology isn't the problem.
