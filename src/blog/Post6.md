Growing up I always had a healthy distrust for banks. Something about an institution having access to my personal information and all the financial transactions associated with it never sat well with me. The fact that I have to rely on a third party for such critical necessities as food and shelter is radically opposed to my uncompromising pursuit for complete independence.

In some not-so-distant parallel universe, there's an old shoe box buried three feet deep in my backyard holding my entire life savings.


## Using a bank

In this universe, I fell in line like everyone else did. And I got used to it. I became a normal contributing member of society, conforming to all the systems and constructs we created to facilitate large scale human coordination.

I got a job. I bought a car. I opened a bank account.

As the years went on, I became more and more comfortable with the idea of keeping my money in a bank. The convenience it afforded me was enough to suppress that nagging feeling that something about it was off.

Until one morning, without any notice, my account was frozen.

At this time in my life, I didn't even have a savings or investment fund. I kept all the money I earned in a single checking account. I liked the simplicity of having it all in one place, and knowing I could access it at any time gave me peace of mind.

*I was wrong.*

A 10-day investigation concluded in a false alarm, all stemming from a $500 overseas purchase I approved that triggered some suspicious activity detection algorithm. Meanwhile I had no way to access my funds and had to uncomfortably resort to borrowing money from people I barely knew in a city I had just moved to.

This was just the beginning of my exposure to the inner workings of the traditional finance world, as I later experienced (talk about banks not letting you withdraw certain amount of money, privacy invasion (Plaid?), predatory practices, etc).

I felt frustrated and disillusioned. My liquid assets were at the mercy of a corrupt banking system that micromanages and overregulates the activities of its everyday citizens while wealthy elites orchestrate earth-shattering financial crimes in plain sight on a daily basis.

But there was nothing I could do about it. These were the systems we had, for better or worse.

## Discovering crypto

Fast-forward to 2018.

It was after midnight on a hot August day when I fatefully stumbled upon the Bitcoin whitepaper. Eight pages containing some of the most compelling software design I'd ever seen. It sought to obliterate everything wrong with the traditional banking system: financial censorship, overbearing government oversight, and the need for trusted intermediaries to buy and sell stuff.

I was hooked.

I started reading and absorbing everything I could about it, even building my own proof-of-work blockchain which I ran on my local machine as a means of understanding the tech more deeply. What I didn't realize at the time is that I was just starting to scratch the surface of a whole new frontier of finance and technology. A brand new paradigm that would warrant most of my waking thought and energy over the next few years.

The deeper I explored, the bigger the rabbithole got. This new uncensorable money called Bitcoin wasn't standing alone in the space. There were trustless application layers like Ethereum, decentralized financial products for earning and borrowing money, and immutable and interoperable digital items that people could share and trade peer-to-peer.

It was new. It was exciting. And most importantly for me, it was trustless. I didn't need to sign up for an account and hand over my personal information to a third party to participate.

It was called *crypto*.

One of the core features of crypto is that its technology offers a novel means of coordination. A more equitable incentive layer where anyone can have a voice, and value can accrue fairly across the contribution pool rather than to a select group of elites. This proposition is what fueled the next few years of crypto innovation, leading to the explosion of DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs.

We weren't just reinventing money, we were reinventing the world. We were building a whole new system. The *right* system.

*But building the right system isn't enough.*

## The human problem

*(something about how the world of DeFi, NFTs, and DAOs wasn't what it seemed like on the surface)*

The benefits of technology will always be limited by the ways humans use it, and this is a problem that technology itself cannot fix. We cannot solve large scale human coordination purely by changing technology.

*We must also change humans.*

Humans are inherently flawed and greed-driven, and the materialization of the crypto space is a stark reflection of that. The last few years is proof that if there is any room to exploit a trustless system for nefarious purposes, it will happen.

Scams. Rug pulls. Smart contract exploits. Governance plutocracies.

Comically overleveraged institutions built on fractional banking.

Centralized projects masquerading as the next generation of finance and ownership, funded by the same venture capital that delivered us the maximalist data privacy exploitation of the modern internet.

The space is littered with them. And game theory dictates that they aren't going away anytime soon.

*How do you fix a trustless system where humans, not technology, are the core problem?*

## A sober reflection

As humans, our tendency towards self-delusion can prevent us from seeing and accepting the truth, which can ultimately hinder our growth and understanding of the world around us.

In the wake of the crypto fallout, I've had to come to terms with the fact that my past self hallucinated a vision that my current self has to now unravel.

It's a slow process, but each day the threads get gradually less tangled and reality comes into focus.
